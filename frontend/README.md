# work-tracker

Simple work tracking app.  Not sure where all your time is going in a day?  Add a couple of buttons and track it!

## Reason

As a developer I keep finding myself waiting on things to happen, which feels highly unproductive and yet I am unsure how
much time I am spending on each of these types of things.  

## Goal

This should be a really simple app that helps the user specify up to 3 things to track.  These items should be presented
as large colorful buttons.  Each button should have the following characteristics:
- Toggle on/off
- Editable name
- Editable type

Ideally you are moving from "idle" -> "task", as an example:
1 idle
2 coding (active task)
3 compiling (wasteful task)
4 user testing (active wasteful)
5 idle

Then have an output/overview of activity.  This isn't meant to be a large scale analysis, but a quick "snapshot" of a workday.

## Adv

- Allow for multiple trackers




### Old Readme

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
